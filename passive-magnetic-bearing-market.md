<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Magnetic Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Type</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passive magnetic bearing market primarily consists of two types: radial type and axial type. Radial type bearings support loads perpendicular to the shaft, utilizing magnetic forces to maintain alignment and minimize friction. They are commonly employed in applications like turbines and motors. Axial type bearings, on the other hand, manage forces parallel to the shaft, suitable for applications requiring stability along the axis, such as in high-speed machinery. Both types enhance efficiency by reducing wear and energy loss.</p></p>
